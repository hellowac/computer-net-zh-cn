Wireshark Lab: HTTP
----------------------

Having gotten our feet wet with the Wireshark packet sniffer in Lab 1, we’re now ready to use Wireshark to investigate protocols in operation. In this lab, we’ll explore several aspects of the HTTP protocol: the basic GET/reply interaction, HTTP message formats, retrieving large HTML files, retrieving HTML files with embedded URLs, persistent and non-persistent connections, and HTTP authentication and security.

As is the case with all Wireshark labs, the full description of this lab is available at this book’s Web site, `www.pearsonhighered.com/cs-resources <https://media.pearsoncmg.com/bc/abp/cs-resources/>`_.

Wireshark Lab: DNS
--------------------

In this lab, we take a closer look at the client side of the DNS, the protocol that translates Internet hostnames to IP addresses. Recall from :ref:`Section 2.5 <c2.5>` that the client’s role in the DNS is relatively simple —a client sends a query to its local DNS server and receives a response back. Much can go on under the covers, invisible to the DNS clients, as the hierarchical DNS servers communicate with each other to either recursively or iteratively resolve the client’s DNS query. From the DNS client’s standpoint, however, the protocol is quite simple—a query is formulated to the local DNS server and a response is received from that server. We observe DNS in action in this lab.
