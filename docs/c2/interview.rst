Marc Andreessen is the co-creator of Mosaic, the Web browser that popularized the World Wide Web in 1993. Mosaic had a clean, easily understood interface and was the first browser to display images in-line with text. In 1994, Marc Andreessen and Jim Clark founded Netscape, whose browser was by far the most popular browser through the mid-1990s. Netscape also developed the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol and many Internet server products, including mail servers and SSL-based Web servers. He is now a co-founder and general partner of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, overseeing portfolio development with holdings that include Facebook, Foursquare, Groupon, Jawbone, Twitter, and Zynga. He serves on numerous boards, including Bump, eBay, Glam Media, Facebook, and Hewlett-Packard. He holds a BS in Computer Science from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

How did you become interested in computing? Did you always know that you wanted to work in information technology?
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The video game and personal computing revolutions hit right when I was growing up—personal computing was the new technology frontier in the late 70’s and early 80’s. And it wasn’t just Apple and the IBM PC, but hundreds of new companies like Commodore and Atari as well. I taught myself to program out of a book called “Instant Freeze-Dried BASIC” at age 10, and got my first computer (a TRS-80 Color Computer—look it up!) at age 12.

Please describe one or two of the most exciting projects you have worked on during your career. What were the biggest challenges?
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Undoubtedly the most exciting project was the original Mosaic web browser in ’92–’93—and the biggest challenge was getting anyone to take it seriously back then. At the time, everyone thought the interactive future would be delivered as “interactive television” by huge companies, not as the Internet by startups.
 
What excites you about the future of networking and the Internet? What are your biggest concerns?
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The most exciting thing is the huge unexplored frontier of applications and services that programmers and entrepreneurs are able to explore—the Internet has unleashed creativity at a level that I don’t think we’ve ever seen before. My biggest concern is the principle of unintended consequences—we don’t always know the implications of what we do, such as the Internet being used by governments to run a new level of surveillance on citizens.

Is there anything in particular students should be aware of as Web technology advances?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The rate of change—the most important thing to learn is how to learn—how to flexibly adapt to changes in the specific technologies, and how to keep an open mind on the new opportunities and possibilities as you move through your career.

What people inspired you professionally?
-------------------------------------------

Vannevar Bush, Ted Nelson, Doug Engelbart, Nolan Bushnell, Bill Hewlett and Dave Packard, Ken Olsen, Steve Jobs, Steve Wozniak, Andy Grove, Grace Hopper, Hedy Lamarr, Alan Turing, Richard Stallman.

What are your recommendations for students who want to pursue careers in computing and information technology?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Go as deep as you possibly can on understanding how technology is created, and then complement with learning how business works.

Can technology solve the world’s problems?
-------------------------------------------

No, but we advance the standard of living of people through economic growth, and most economic growth throughout history has come from technology—so that’s as good as it gets.
