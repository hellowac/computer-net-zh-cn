:ref:`Sections 1.1 <c1.1>` through :ref:`1.6 <c1.6>` presented an overview of the technology of computer networking and the
Internet. You should know enough now to impress your family and friends! However, if you really want to
be a big hit at the next cocktail party, you should sprinkle your discourse with tidbits about the
fascinating history of the Internet :ref:`[Segaller 1998] <Segaller 1998>`.

1.7.1 The Development of Packet Switching: 1961-1972

The field of computer networking and today’s Internet trace their beginnings back to the early 1960s,
when the telephone network was the world’s dominant communication network. Recall from :ref:`Section 1.3 <c1.3>`
that the telephone network uses circuit switching to transmit information from a sender to a receiver—an
appropriate choice given that voice is transmitted at a constant rate between sender and receiver. Given
the increasing importance of computers in the early 1960s and the advent of timeshared computers, it
was perhaps natural to consider how to hook computers together so that they could be shared among
geographically distributed users. The traffic generated by such users was likely to be bursty—intervals
of activity, such as the sending of a command to a remote computer, followed by periods of inactivity
while waiting for a reply or while contemplating the received response.

Three research groups around the world, each unaware of the others’ work :ref:`[Leiner 1998] <Leiner 1998>`, began
inventing packet switching as an efficient and robust alternative to circuit switching. The first published
work on packet-switching techniques was that of Leonard Kleinrock [ :ref:`Kleinrock 1961 <Kleinrock 1961>`; :ref:`Kleinrock 1964 <Kleinrock 1964>` ],
then a graduate student at MIT. Using queuing theory, Kleinrock’s work elegantly demonstrated the
effectiveness of the packet-switching approach for bursty traffic sources. In 1964, Paul Baran :ref:`[Baran 1964] <Baran 1964>` at the Rand Institute had begun investigating the use of packet switching for secure voice over
military networks, and at the National Physical Laboratory in England, Donald Davies and Roger
Scantlebury were also developing their ideas on packet switching.

The work at MIT, Rand, and the NPL laid the foundations for today’s Internet. But the Internet also has a
long history of a let’s-build-it-and-demonstrate-it attitude that also dates back to the 1960s. J. C. R.
Licklider :ref:`[DEC 1990] <DEC 1990>` and Lawrence Roberts, both colleagues of Kleinrock’s at MIT, went on to lead the
computer science program at the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA) in the United States.
Roberts published an overall plan for the ARPAnet :ref:`[Roberts 1967] <Roberts 1967>` , the first packet-switched computer
network and a direct ancestor of today’s public Internet. On Labor Day in 1969, the first packet switch
was installed at UCLA under Kleinrock’s supervision, and three additional packet switches were installed
shortly thereafter at the Stanford Research Institute (SRI), UC Santa Barbara, and the University of Utah
(:ref:`Figure 1.26 <Figure 1.26>`). The fledgling precursor to the Internet was four nodes large by the end of 1969. Kleinrock
recalls the very first use of the network to perform a remote login from UCLA to SRI, crashing the
system :ref:`[Kleinrock 2004] <Kleinrock 2004>`.

By 1972, ARPAnet had grown to approximately 15 nodes and was given its first public demonstration by
Robert Kahn. The first host-to-host protocol between ARPAnet end systems, known as the network-
control protocol (NCP), was completed :ref:`RFC 001 <RFC 001>`. With an end-to-end protocol available, applications
could now be written. Ray Tomlinson wrote the first e-mail program in 1972.

The initial ARPAnet was a single, closed network. In order to communicate with an ARPAnet host, one
had to be actually attached to another ARPAnet IMP. In the early to mid-1970s, additional stand-alone
packet-switching networks besides ARPAnet came into being: ALOHANet, a microwave network linking
universities on the Hawaiian islands :ref:`[Abramson 1970] <Abramson 1970>`, as well as DARPA’s packet-satellite :ref:`[RFC 829] <RFC 829>` and packet-radio networks :ref:`[Kahn 1978] <Kahn 1978>`; Telenet, a BBN commercial packet-­switching network based
on ARPAnet technology; Cyclades, a French packet-switching network pioneered by Louis Pouzin
:ref:`[Think 2012] <Think 2012>` ; Time-sharing networks such as Tymnet and the GE Information Services network, among
others, in the late 1960s and early 1970s :ref:`[Schwartz 1977] <Schwartz 1977>` ; IBM’s SNA (1969–1974), which paralleled
the ARPAnet work :ref:`[Schwartz 1977] <Schwartz 1977>`.

**Figure 1.26 An early packet switch**

The number of networks was growing. With perfect hindsight we can see that the time was ripe for
developing an encompassing architecture for connecting networks together. Pioneering work on
interconnecting networks (under the sponsorship of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency
(DARPA)), in essence creating a *network of networks*, was done by Vinton Cerf and Robert Kahn :ref:`[Cerf 1974] <Cerf 1974>` ; the term internetting was coined to describe this work.

These architectural principles were embodied in TCP. The early versions of TCP, however, were quite
different from today’s TCP. The early versions of TCP combined a reliable in-sequence delivery of data
via end-system retransmission (still part of today’s TCP) with forwarding functions (which today are
performed by IP). Early experimentation with TCP, combined with the recognition of the importance of
an unreliable, non-flow-controlled, end-to-end transport service for applications such as packetized
voice, led to the separation of IP out of TCP and the development of the UDP protocol. The three key
Internet protocols that we see today—TCP, UDP, and IP—were conceptually in place by the end of the
1970s.

In addition to the DARPA Internet-related research, many other important networking activities were
underway. In Hawaii, Norman Abramson was developing ALOHAnet, a packet-based radio network that
allowed multiple remote sites on the Hawaiian Islands to communicate with each other. The ALOHA
protocol :ref:`[Abramson 1970] <Abramson 1970>` was the first multiple-access protocol, allowing geographically distributed
users to share a single broadcast communication medium (a radio ­frequency). Metcalfe and Boggs
built on Abramson’s multiple-access protocol work when they developed the Ethernet protocol :ref:`[Metcalfe 1976] <Metcalfe 1976>` for wire-based shared broadcast networks. Interestingly, Metcalfe and Boggs’ Ethernet protocol
was motivated by the need to connect multiple PCs, printers, and shared disks :ref:`[Perkins 1994] <Perkins 1994>` . Twenty-
five years ago, well before the PC revolution and the explosion of networks, Metcalfe and Boggs were
laying the foundation for today’s PC LANs.

1.7.3 A Proliferation of Networks: 1980-1990

By the end of the 1970s, approximately two hundred hosts were connected to the ARPAnet. By the end
of the 1980s the number of hosts connected to the public ­Internet, a confederation of networks looking
much like today’s Internet, would reach a hundred thousand. The 1980s would be a time of tremendous
growth.

Much of that growth resulted from several distinct efforts to create computer networks linking universities
together. BITNET provided e-mail and file transfers among several universities in the Northeast. CSNET
(computer science network) was formed to link university researchers who did not have access to
ARPAnet. In 1986, NSFNET was created to provide access to NSF-sponsored supercomputing centers.
Starting with an initial backbone speed of 56 kbps, NSFNET’s backbone would be running at 1.5 Mbps
by the end of the decade and would serve as a primary backbone linking regional networks.

In the ARPAnet community, many of the final pieces of today’s Internet architecture were falling into
place. January 1, 1983 saw the official deployment of TCP/IP as the new standard host protocol for
ARPAnet (replacing the NCP protocol). The transition :ref:`[RFC 801] <RFC 801>` from NCP to TCP/IP was a flag day
event—all hosts were required to transfer over to TCP/IP as of that day. In the late 1980s, important
extensions were made to TCP to implement host-based congestion control :ref:`[Jacobson 1988] <Jacobson 1988>` . The DNS,
used to map between a human-readable Internet name (for example, gaia.cs.umass.edu) and its 32-bit
IP address, was also developed :ref:`[RFC 1034] <RFC 1034>` .

Paralleling this development of the ARPAnet (which was for the most part a US effort), in the early
1980s the French launched the Minitel project, an ambitious plan to bring data networking into
everyone’s home. Sponsored by the French government, the Minitel system consisted of a public
packet-switched network (based on the X.25 protocol suite), Minitel servers, and inexpensive terminals
with built-in low-speed modems. The Minitel became a huge success in 1984 when the French
government gave away a free Minitel terminal to each French household that wanted one. Minitel sites
included free sites—such as a telephone directory site—as well as private sites, which collected a
usage-based fee from each user. At its peak in the mid 1990s, it offered more than 20,000 services,
ranging from home banking to specialized research databases. The Minitel was in a large proportion of
French homes 10 years before most Americans had ever heard of the Internet.

1.7.4 The Internet Explosion: The 1990s

.. tab:: 中文

The 1990s were ushered in with a number of events that symbolized the continued evolution and the
soon-to-arrive commercialization of the Internet. ARPAnet, the progenitor of the Internet, ceased to
exist. In 1991, NSFNET lifted its restrictions on the use of NSFNET for commercial purposes. NSFNET
itself would be decommissioned in 1995, with Internet backbone traffic being carried by commercial
Internet Service Providers.

The main event of the 1990s was to be the emergence of the World Wide Web application, which
brought the Internet into the homes and businesses of millions of people worldwide. The Web served as
a platform for enabling and deploying hundreds of new applications that we take for granted today,
including search (e.g., Google and Bing) Internet commerce (e.g., Amazon and eBay) and social
networks (e.g., Facebook).

The Web was invented at CERN by Tim Berners-Lee between 1989 and 1991 :ref:`[Berners-Lee 1989] <Berners-Lee 1989>` ,
based on ideas originating in earlier work on hypertext from the 1940s by Vannevar Bush :ref:`[Bush 1945] <Bush 1945>`
and since the 1960s by Ted Nelson :ref:`[Xanadu 2012] <Xanadu 2012>` . Berners-Lee and his associates developed initial
versions of HTML, HTTP, a Web server, and a browser—the four key components of the Web. Around
the end of 1993 there were about two hundred Web servers in operation, this collection of servers being
just a harbinger of what was about to come. At about this time several researchers were developing
Web browsers with GUI interfaces, including Marc Andreessen, who along with Jim Clark, formed
Mosaic Communications, which later became Netscape Communications Corporation [ :ref:`[Cusumano 1998] <Cusumano 1998>` ; :ref:`[Quittner 1998] <Quittner 1998>` ]. By 1995, university students were using Netscape browsers to surf the Web on a
daily basis. At about this time companies—big and small—began to operate Web servers and transact
commerce over the Web. In 1996, Microsoft started to make browsers, which started the browser war
between Netscape and Microsoft, which Microsoft won a few years later :ref:`[Cusumano 1998] <Cusumano 1998>` .

The second half of the 1990s was a period of tremendous growth and innovation for the Internet, with
major corporations and thousands of startups creating Internet products and services. By the end of the
millennium the Internet was supporting hundreds of popular applications, including four killer
applications:

- E-mail, including attachments and Web-accessible e-mail
- The Web, including Web browsing and Internet commerce
- Instant messaging, with contact lists
- Peer-to-peer file sharing of MP3s, pioneered by Napster

Interestingly, the first two killer applications came from the research community, whereas the last two
were created by a few young entrepreneurs.

The period from 1995 to 2001 was a roller-coaster ride for the Internet in the financial markets. Before
they were even profitable, hundreds of Internet startups made initial public offerings and started to be
traded in a stock market. Many companies were valued in the billions of dollars without having any
significant revenue streams. The Internet stocks collapsed in 2000–2001, and many startups shut down.
Nevertheless, a number of companies emerged as big winners in the Internet space, including
Microsoft, Cisco, Yahoo, e-Bay, Google, and Amazon.

1.7.5 The New Millennium

Innovation in computer networking continues at a rapid pace. Advances are being made on all fronts,
including deployments of faster routers and higher transmission speeds in both access networks and in
network backbones. But the following developments merit special attention:

- Since the beginning of the millennium, we have been seeing aggressive deployment of broadband Internet access to homes—not only cable modems and DSL but also fiber to the home, as discussed in :ref:`Section 1.2 <c1.2>` . This high-speed Internet access has set the stage for a wealth of video applications, including the distribution of user-generated video (for example, YouTube), on-demand streaming of movies and television shows (e.g., Netflix), and multi-person video conference (e.g., Skype, Facetime, and Google Hangouts).
- The increasing ubiquity of high-speed (54 Mbps and higher) public WiFi networks and medium- speed (tens of Mbps) Internet access via 4G cellular telephony networks is not only making it possible to remain constantly connected while on the move, but also enabling new location-specific applications such as Yelp, Tinder, Yik Yak, and Waz. The number of wireless devices connecting to the Internet surpassed the number of wired devices in 2011. This high-speed wireless access has set the stage for the rapid emergence of hand-held computers (iPhones, Androids, iPads, and so on), which enjoy constant and untethered access to the Internet.
- Online social networks—such as Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, and WeChat (hugely popular in China)—have created massive people networks on top of the Internet. Many of these social networks are extensively used for messaging as well as photo sharing. Many Internet users today “live” primarily within one or more social networks. Through their APIs, the online social networks create platforms for new networked applications and distributed games.
- As discussed in :ref:`Section 1.3.3 <c1.3.3>`, online service providers, such as Google and Microsoft, have deployed their own extensive private networks, which not only connect together their globally distributed data centers, but are used to bypass the Internet as much as possible by peering directly with lower-tier ISPs. As a result, Google provides search results and e-mail access almost instantaneously, as if their data centers were running within one’s own computer.
- Many Internet commerce companies are now running their applications in the “cloud”—such as in Amazon’s EC2, in Google’s Application Engine, or in Microsoft’s Azure. Many companies and universities have also migrated their Internet applications (e.g., e-mail and Web hosting) to the cloud. Cloud companies not only provide applications scalable computing and storage environments, but also provide the applications implicit access to their high-performance private networks.
