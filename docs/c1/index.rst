Chapter 1 Computer Networks and the Internet

    Today’s Internet is arguably the largest engineered system ever created by ­mankind, with hundreds of
    millions of connected computers, communication links, and switches; with billions of users who connect
    via laptops, tablets, and smartphones; and with an array of new Internet-connected “things” including
    game consoles, surveillance systems, watches, eye glasses, thermostats, body scales, and cars. Given
    that the Internet is so large and has so many diverse components and uses, is there any hope of
    understanding how it works? Are there guiding principles and structure that can provide a foundation for
    understanding such an amazingly large and complex system? And if so, is it possible that it actually
    could be both interesting and fun to learn about computer networks? Fortunately, the answer to all of
    these questions is a resounding YES! Indeed, it’s our aim in this book to provide you with a modern
    introduction to the dynamic field of computer networking, giving you the principles and practical insights
    you’ll need to understand not only today’s networks, but tomorrow’s as well.

    This first chapter presents a broad overview of computer networking and the Internet. Our goal here is to
    paint a broad picture and set the context for the rest of this book, to see the forest through the trees.
    We’ll cover a lot of ground in this introductory chapter and discuss a lot of the pieces of a computer
    network, without losing sight of the big picture.

    We’ll structure our overview of computer networks in this chapter as follows. After introducing some
    basic terminology and concepts, we’ll first examine the basic hardware and software components that
    make up a network. We’ll begin at the network’s edge and look at the end systems and network
    applications running in the network. We’ll then explore the core of a computer network, examining the
    links and the switches that transport data, as well as the access networks and physical media that
    connect end systems to the network core. We’ll learn that the Internet is a network of networks, and we’ll
    learn how these networks connect with each other.

    After having completed this overview of the edge and core of a computer network, we’ll take the broader
    and more abstract view in the second half of this chapter. We’ll examine delay, loss, and throughput of
    data in a computer network and provide simple quantitative models for end-to-end throughput and delay:
    models that take into account transmission, propagation, and queuing delays. We’ll then introduce some
    of the key architectural principles in computer networking, namely, protocol layering and service models.
    We’ll also learn that computer networks are vulnerable to many different types of attacks; we’ll survey
    some of these attacks and consider how computer networks can be made more secure. Finally, we’ll
    close this chapter with a brief history of computer networking.
