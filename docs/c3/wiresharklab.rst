Wireshark Lab: Exploring TCP
------------------------------

In this lab, you’ll use your Web browser to access a file from a Web server. As in earlier Wireshark labs, you’ll use Wireshark to capture the packets arriving at your computer. Unlike earlier labs, you’ll also be able to download a Wireshark-readable packet trace from the Web server from which you downloaded the file. In this server trace, you’ll find the packets that were generated by your own access of the Web server. You’ll analyze the client- and server-side traces to explore aspects of TCP. In particular, you’ll evaluate the performance of the TCP connection between your computer and the Web server. You’ll trace TCP’s window behavior, and infer packet loss, retransmission, flow control and congestion control behavior, and estimated roundtrip time. 

As is the case with all Wireshark labs, the full description of this lab is available at this book’s Web site, www.pearsonhighered.com/cs-resources.

Wireshark Lab: Exploring UDP
-----------------------------

In this short lab, you’ll do a packet capture and analysis of your favorite application that uses UDP (for example, DNS or a multimedia application such as Skype). As we learned in :ref:`Section 3.3 <c3.3>`, UDP is a simple, no-frills transport protocol. In this lab, you’ll investigate the header fields in the UDP segment as well as the checksum calculation.
